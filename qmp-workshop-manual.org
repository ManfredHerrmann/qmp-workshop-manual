#+TITLE: quick Mesh project (qMp.cat) workshop
#+AUTHOR: guifi.net community

* Introduction
The basic material to deploy qMp networks.

The devices used have Power over Ethernet (PoE) of 24 V, it means that the electrical power and data of the device goes through an ethernet cable. The blue cable in figure [[fig:poe]] is what is deployed into an outdoor place (typically rooftop or a balcony) where the qMp devices will be installed and takes the PoE interface in PoE injector. The other interface in the PoE injector is LAN [fn:46] and can be placed to a PC or a switch/router if it is wanted to connect more PC's. Finally, the PoE injector requires standard electrical power. *Warning*: a PoE connection to a device that is not prepared to work with PoE 24 V, for example an ethernet interface of a computer, can produce malfunction of its ethernet interface.

* Installer basics: Items
- Outdoor cable and rj45 connectors (sold separately) \\
  The cable should be for outdoor to resist the weather.
  - UTP cable: cable without protection. But sometimes it is enough.
  - FTP cable (recommended): cable with basic protection. ESD prevention [fn:13]. The difference is that the cable has ground.
- Crimp tool: to join rj45 connector to cable.
- Cable tester (recommended): a unexpensive one can help to work quickly and reliably in the installation of cable.
- Cable cutter: To take a segment of cable for a installation. Note: UTP cable is easier to cut than FTP.
- Cable tie: To lock the cable & device to a antenna pole and other cables.
- Shopping cart or traveling bag with wheels (recommended): carry all the items needed.
- Measure meter: measure accurately the length of cable needed (optional).
* Installer basics: 5 GHz devices
The devices selected are working in the 5 GHz band because 2.4 GHz is widely used in cities and have more interferences. They are from Ubiquiti manufacturer and compatible with qMp firmware.

 - Unexpensive :: around 70 euro.

   - NanoStation Loco M5 (NSLM5) :: Short distances (less than 1 km). The connection with the other candidate node has an acceptable connection and there is no need to increase the power signal of wifi. It uses the same firmware as NanostationM5.
   - Nanostation M5 (NSM5) :: [fn:14] If is needed a better connection to specific node.
   - NanoBeam M5 (NBM5) different models :: [fn:18] When there is a long distance connection (more than 1 km).
   - XW series :: Are new versions of devices NSLM5, NSM5, etc. but with new processors. The first introduced was NBM5 as a replacement to NanoBridge M5 (now deprecated). This devices requires qMp 4 and is not stable yet. The rest of devices specified are AirMax (XM) and use qMp 3.1 (stable release).

 - Expensive :: between 100 and 300 euro.

   - Rocket M5  :: [fn:15] Base station to put different kind of devices.
     - Rocket M5 + Sector Antenna (S) 90 or 120 deg :: [fn:19] when the need is to cover a zone region with constant coverage of 90 or 120 deg from the device. There are High Gain (HG) and Mid Gain (MG) versions.
     - Rocket M5 + Dish (D) :: [fn:17] Longest distances (50 km link [fn:16]).

* qMp basics: Testing operations
Figure [[fig:wan-status-on]] shows the first screen obtained when there is a log in a qMp node.

When there is a scroll down action, appears Associated Stations. Figure [[fig:associated-stations]] has the wifi links with other qMp nodes and what signal associated (dBm). The guifi.net good practices says that the backbone should be better than -75dBm [fn:2]. In that figure there are different kind of links with different qualities. Good quality means high parameters of: dBm, RX Rate, TX Rate [bandwidth (Mbps)] and MCS codification (the number).

These qualities refer to connection to different nodes, only is shown the MAC address. But the MAC is enough to identify a node, because the last four characters are appended in every hostname of the network. Later, it will be known how to navigate to different nodes in the network.

#+CAPTION: Associated stations
#+NAME: fig:associated-stations
[[./img/qMp-basics-scrot/status-associated-nodes.png]]

Another measure of quality is shown on Figure [[fig:links-node]]. This is the quality in terms of the protocol bmx6. A 0-100 rating in terms of reception and transmission (rx/tx).

The situation could be that cannot be a connection to the node to the network. Perhaps it is in another channel. Figure [[fig:find-qmp]] shows a wifi scan. qMp always use BSSID: =02:CA:FF:EE:BA:BE=, in Mode =Ad-Hoc=. These are two solid references to find other qMp networks. In the figure there are two qMp networks in channels: 140 and 132.

If there is a design of a new qMp network it is important to select a channel that is not used. Figure [[fig:interference]] shows how another AP is also using channel 140.

#+CAPTION: Wifi scan interference
#+NAME: fig:interference
[[./img/qMp-basics-scrot/wifi_scan_interference.png]]

Figure [[wifi-channel-power]] shows where to change wifi parameters as wifi channel and power signal to the qMp network. By default, qMp uses 17, but it can be increased to 22 (max value).

Use the transmission power of wifi signal with care, in the interested network is a communication signal, but for the other networks it is another noise in the environment that make its communications more difficult.

Figure [[fig:tunnels]] (marked as red) shows that there is a WAN Node, the node makes announcement of this network as =Internet=. If can be arrived there, it means there is an internet connection, try it with a browser. Also could be interesting to perform additional bandwidth tests [fn:3] [fn:4] [fn:5] [fn:6].

But perhaps the WAN node cannot be accessed, or there is not a WAN node in the network. Can be checked if there is a tunnel to Internet.

In the same view, can be browsed for a Border Node. Figure [[fig:tunnels]] shows it (marked as blue), the node makes announcement of the network =10.0.0.0/8=, it means, access to the rest of guifi.net

* qMp basics: Basic install and maintaining
Figure [[fig:quick-setup]], this is the final setup when the node is prepared to be in testing phase.

In guifi.net web page, after adding the device, it is received a unique ip address, and is needed a =255.255.255.244= netmask. Use the same name as in the web or the network organization page.

For upgrade the node at the moment it is only possible via terminal. Do a login with ssh session:
: ssh root@admin.qmp
password: 13f \\ From this point, there are three methods:
1. Automatic upgrade (with internet connection in the node).
   : qmpcontrol upgrade
2. Upgrade with a link (with internet connection in the node).
   : qmpcontrol upgrade "http://...qmp.bin"
   It means the URL where is located the qMp firmware, remember that can be found all the firmwares supported here: http://fw.qmp.cat
3. Upgrade with a local file (without internet connection in the node).
   1. Put the file inside qMp node, open a new terminal and put
      : scp qmp.bin root@admin.qmp:/tmp
      It will ask for the password
   2. With the existing ssh session opened before, or a new one,
      login with ssh and:
      : qmpcontrol upgrade "/tmp/qmp.bin"
Confirm to continue with the upgrade process and wait until it is finished.

Note: qMp only save common settings after the upgrade, concretely:
: # cat /etc/config/qmp | grep preserve

For other file changes, perform a backup before the upgrade.
* qMp basics: Navigating inside the network
Figure [[fig:net-nodes]] shows a screen that presents all the qMp nodes conforming the network. By clicking the blue spherical icon to the left of each node it is possible to obtain additional information about them. In particular, the network address announced by one node can be found under the =Gateways announced= label, and the IP of the node in the first address of that network. In the example shown in the figure, the network address is =10.1.56.96= and the IP of the qMp node is =10.1.56.97=.

* Proposed qMp network node designs: WAN node design
To build a WAN node, figure [[fig:wan-gen]] shows how the qMp node should be connected to the /mesh/ network (through wifi via bmx6 routing) and Internet (through ethernet to ISP [fn:50] router via DCHP client).

It is recommended to use the device Nanostation M5 because it has two ethernet interfaces (eth0, eth1). With one can be made a DHCP server to connect to the qMp node with a laptop. And for the other ethernet, a DHCP client to the ISP router.

In the case that there is a Nanostation Loco M5, it only has one ethernet (eth0 [fn:51]). It will be for the DHCP client to the ISP router and it means that there is no DHCP server to directly connect to the qMp node. An easy solution is that the connection to the qMp node could be possible with another qMp node in the network (it is being used the wifi interface).

#+CAPTION: Network diagram generic WAN node
#+NAME: fig:wan-gen
[[./img/mesh-designs/wan_node_generic.png]]

To set the ethernet that will do the DHCP client to the ISP router there are 2 options.

Option 1: in the quick setup, last part says what to do with interfaces (figure [[fig:quickdhcp]]). The interfaces have 3 selections: =Mesh=, =Lan= (DHCP server) and =WAN= (DHCP client).

#+CAPTION: Option 1: Set DHCP client to interface with quick setup
#+NAME: fig:quickdhcp
[[./img/qMp-basics-scrot/quick_setup_interfaces.png]]

Option 2: Figure [[fig:netset]] shows the screen that set the DHCP client interface, and there is no need to do a quick setup with the node.

* Flash qMp node
Steps to flash a device with qMp firmware. It is assumed a GNU/Linux Ubuntu/Debian computer:
1. Download the *Factory image* [fn:7] for a supported device that
   has the factory operating system [fn:8]. *Sysupgrade image* is for OpenWRT or qMp nodes that want to upgrade. *Guifi image* has better integration with guifi.net web.
2. Rename the downloaded file to =qmp.bin=.
3. Download the tftp packets with the system's repository. In
   terminal: =$ sudo apt-get install tftp-hpa=.
4. Disconnect the internet connection.
5. Open a terminal and put:
   : $ ping 192.168.1.20
   It will help to know when the device is in the reset mode.
6. Connect the equipments as shown in Figure [[fig:flashdiagram]].
   #+CAPTION: Network Diagram to Flash Device
   #+NAME: fig:flashdiagram
   [[./img/general/flashdiagram.jpg]]
7. Configure the network following one of these options:
   1. *GUI option*: configure in the preferred network manager a
      ethernet network with static IP in the computer to connect to the device: \\ IP: 192.168.1.10 \\ Subnet: 192.168.1.100 \\ Gateway: 192.168.1.1
   2. *Terminal option*: 
      : $ sudo ip a a 192.168.1.25/24 dev eth0
8. Reset the device following one of these options:
   1. *Reset in the device option*: Disconnect the interface of the
      device. Remove the device's lid. With one hand take an object with round toe, press and hold reset button (Figure [[fig:resetant]]) while with the other hand insert the ethernet cable to the interface in device.
      #+CAPTION: Reset device
      #+NAME: fig:resetant
      [[./img/general/reset-device.jpg]]
   2. *Reset in the PoE injector option*: Check if the device has
      PoE (Figure [[fig:resetpoe]]). Disconnect the PoE interface in PoE injector. With one hand take an object with round toe, press and hold reset button while with the other hand insert the ethernet cable to the PoE interface in PoE injector.
      #+CAPTION: Reset power injector
      #+NAME: fig:resetpoe
      [[./img/general/reset-injector.jpg]]
9. Observe if the device start the reset mode needed for continue:
   - *Device led option*: Wait until the led 1 and 3 change to 2 and
     4 cyclically. With this video resource it will give an idea of time and led colors involved in the process [fn:9].
   - *PC screen option*: the ping starts responding. The output of the
     =ping 192.168.1.20= should be something like:
    : 64 bytes from X: icmp_req=X ttl=X time=X ms
10. If is in reset mode stop pressing the reset button and put the
    device in a stable place.
11. In a new terminal window, go where is the downloaded firmware
    =qmp.bin=:
    : cd /path/to/the/qmpbin_folder
    And there, execute:
    : $ tftp 192.168.1.20
    : $ mode octet
    : $ trace
    : $ put qmp.bin
    [ Transmission process ]
    : $ quit
12. After about 5 minutes, the 4th led of the ramp (the most right led,
    Figure [[fig:ledsdevice]]) is on, and not blinking. This is the moment to go the next step.
    #+CAPTION: Led system in the device
    #+NAME: fig:ledsdevice
    [[./img/general/blinkingled.jpeg]]
13. Reconfigure the network to do a DHCP client in ethernet port
    (Automatic IP) and try to connect again the PC with the device.
14. Check that the device responds to ping:
    : $ ping 172.30.22.1
    This is the fixed IP address in roaming mode. \\ More general approach is to get the gateway address:
    : $ ip r | grep default | cut -f3 -d' '
    Open a web browser and check if this web can be accessed (*Warning* admin.qmp it will only work if the PC is connected to the device via DHCP):
    : http://admin.qmp
    alternatives:
    : http://172.30.22.1
    : http://<gateway_ip>
15. Login access is
    user: root \\ password: 13f

* Making a panorama with Hugin
With Hugin it is very easy to do panorama photos, and is free open source software [fn:45].

1. How to do the photos? Take the same physical point and start doing photos with 20% of overlap between them.
2. Follow the steps in Hugin's program (Figure: [[fig:hugin]])
   1. =1.Load images=, select all images in the folder it is wanted to do a panorama.
   2. =2.Align=.
      - this takes a process to search for control points for give sensation of continuity in the photo.
      - if there is not enough control points, search control points manually or do the photos again.
   3. =3.Create panorama=: save a .pto and .tiff files in the folder with all images.
   #+CAPTION: Hugin
   #+NAME: fig:hugin
   [[./img/general/hugin.png]]
3. Conversion of .tiff to .jpeg \\
   If it is wanted to share the panorama.
   : sudo apt-get install imagemagick
   : convert pan.tiff pan.jpeg
   An example is showed in figure [[fig:exhugin]]

* About monitoring
Perform a monitoring of the network is important as a measure of quality assurance. Are presented 3 alternatives.
** *From the guifi web*
can be obtained the graphs. It helps to know if the device is up, its ping and the network traffic. Figure [[fig:snpservices]] shows how it looks like.

#+CAPTION: Graph server in guifi.net
#+NAME: fig:snpservices
[[./img/general/snpservices.png]]

It is required a qMp version with guifi package: =qMp-Guifi= should appear in the bin package name.

The server part uses a package developed by guifi.net community called =snpservices=. For install it can be followed this guide [fn:48], basically, a Debian repository is obtained, it is installed the package and is set the id of the graph server (other parameters remain default). To obtain the id of the graph server create a service of type graph server in the guifi.net web. For example, the id of the graph server of Barcelona can be obtained from the URL: =http://guifi.net/en/node/55045=, and it is =55045=.

qMp uses the package =mini_snmpd= [fn:49] configured to the guifi.net website. After creating the node and the device in the web, it generates the =unsolclic= file. Figure [[fig:qmpguifi]] shows how simple is: put there the URL of the device and apply.

#+CAPTION: guifi.net menu in qMp firmware
#+NAME: fig:qmpguifi
[[./img/qMp-basics-scrot/qmpguifi.png]]
** *munin*:
For a GNU/Linux Debian 7 Wheezy server (apache 2.2)
: sudo apt-get install munin
by default it does monitoring of the server itself (localhost).

For make the graphs available for every user [fn:47] in order to follow the Community Network model of open all network data change the following lines in =/etc/munin/apache.conf=:
: Order allow,deny
: Allow from localhost 127.0.0.0/8 ::1
: Options None
like so:
: Order allow,deny
: Allow from all
: Options FollowSymLinks SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
Apply the changes in the HTTP server:
: # service apache2 restart

Add qMp nodes for monitor them editing the file =/etc/munin/munin.conf=:
#+begin_src conf
[qMp-node1] address 10.x.x.x use_node_name yes [qMp-node2] address 10.x.x.x use_node_name yes
#+end_src

Apply the changes in the monitor (it will start appearing after few minutes):
: # service munin-node restart
The graphics are very similar to those of guifi, but provide more information. Except that there is an error with network traffic monitoring and is not provided.
** *qmpsu*:
At the moment, there is not a generic package of qmpsu for qMp networks, only for Sants Poblenou. More information see [[Situation of mesh networks in Barcelona]]. Figure [[fig:qmpsu]] shows how it looks like.
